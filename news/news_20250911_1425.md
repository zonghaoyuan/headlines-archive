| world | Systematic attribution of heatwaves to the emissions of carbon majors | Extreme event attribution assesses how climate change affected climate extremes, but typically focuses on single events1–4. Furthermore, these attributions rarely quantify the extent to which anthropogenic actors have contributed to these events5,6. Here we show that climate change made 213 historical heatwaves reported over 2000–2023 more likely and more intense, to which each of the 180 carbon majors (fossil fuel and cement producers) substantially contributed. This work relies on the expansion of a well-established event-based framework1. Owing to global warming since 1850–1900, the median of the heatwaves during 2000–2009 became about 20 times more likely, and about 200 times more likely during 2010–2019. Overall, one-quarter of these events were virtually impossible without climate change. The emissions of the carbon majors contribute to half the increase in heatwave intensity since 1850–1900. Depending on the carbon major, their individual contribution is high enough to enable the occurrence of 16–53 heatwaves that would have been virtually impossible in a preindustrial climate. We, therefore, establish that the influence of climate change on heatwaves has increased, and that all carbon majors, even the smaller ones, contributed substantially to the occurrence of heatwaves. Our results contribute to filling the evidentiary gap to establish accountability of historical climate extremes7,8. Climate change made 213 historical heatwaves reported over 2000–2023 more likely and more intense, to which each of the 180 carbon majors (fossil fuel and cement producers) substantially contributed. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09450-9?error=cookies_not_supported&code=621badf4-de55-4dd7-a1e4-d0ecf5ef4ed3 |

| science | ABCA7 variants impact phosphatidylcholine and mitochondria in neurons | Loss-of-function variants in the lipid transporter ABCA7 substantially increase the risk of Alzheimer’s disease1,2, yet how they impact cellular states to drive disease remains unclear. Here, using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing analysis of human brain samples, we identified widespread gene expression changes across multiple neural cell types associated with rare ABCA7 loss-of-function variants. Excitatory neurons, which expressed the highest levels of ABCA7, showed disrupted lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, DNA repair and synaptic signalling pathways. Similar transcriptional disruptions occurred in neurons carrying the common Alzheimer’s-associated variant ABCA7 p.Ala1527Gly3, predicted by molecular dynamics simulations to alter the ABCA7 structure. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS)-cell-derived neurons with ABCA7 loss-of-function variants recapitulated these transcriptional changes, displaying impaired mitochondrial function, increased oxidative stress and disrupted phosphatidylcholine metabolism. Supplementation with CDP-choline increased phosphatidylcholine synthesis, reversed these abnormalities and normalized amyloid-β secretion and neuronal hyperexcitability—key Alzheimer’s features that are exacerbated by ABCA7 dysfunction. Our results implicate disrupted phosphatidylcholine metabolism in ABCA7-related Alzheimer’s risk and highlight a possible therapeutic approach. Loss-of-function variants of ABCA7, associated with Alzheimer’s disease, result in disrupted lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, DNA repair and synaptic signalling pathways in the human brain. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09520-y?error=cookies_not_supported&code=4d60e5ac-3dfc-4da6-ad67-c80acc96b65f |
| science | Stabilizing effect of amino acids on protein and colloidal dispersions | Amino acids (AAs) have a long history of being used as stabilizers for biological media1. For example, they are important components in biomedical formulations. The effect of AAs on biological systems is also starting to be appreciated. For example, it is believed that water-stressed cells increase the levels of AAs to prevent protein aggregation2. Several hypotheses have been put forward regarding their function, ranging from water-structuring3 to hydrotropic4 to specific effects such as stabilization against misfolding, yet it is not known whether their stabilizing function is protein specific or a generic colloidal property. Here we deduce that AAs possess a new and broad colloidal property: they stabilize patchy nanoscale colloids by adsorbing onto their surfaces through weak interactions. We demonstrate this general property by careful experimental evaluation of the stabilizing effect of AAs on dispersions of various proteins, plasmid DNA and non-biological nanoparticles. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical framework that captures this phenomenon and experimentally corroborate several new broad theoretical implications that apply beyond AAs. In vivo experiments further demonstrate that the addition of 1 M proline to insulin doubles its bioavailability in blood. Overall, our results indicate that the role of small molecules is as important as that of ionic strength and should always be reported in biophysics experiments. Amino acids possess a new and broad colloidal property: they stabilize patchy nanoscale colloids, such as proteins, by adsorbing onto their surfaces through weak interactions. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09506-w?error=cookies_not_supported&code=bb288468-0c5d-441d-b98b-836a49b4b24e |
| science | Redox-driven mineral and organic associations in Jezero Crater, Mars | The Perseverance rover has explored and sampled igneous and sedimentary rocks within Jezero Crater to characterize early Martian geological processes and habitability and search for potential biosignatures1–7. Upon entering Neretva Vallis, on Jezero Crater’s western edge8, Perseverance investigated distinctive mudstone and conglomerate outcrops of the Bright Angel formation. Here we report a detailed geological, petrographic and geochemical survey of these rocks and show that organic-carbon-bearing mudstones in the Bright Angel formation contain submillimetre-scale nodules and millimetre-scale reaction fronts enriched in ferrous iron phosphate and sulfide minerals, likely vivianite and greigite, respectively. This organic carbon appears to have participated in post-depositional redox reactions that produced the observed iron-phosphate and iron-sulfide minerals. Geological context and petrography indicate that these reactions occurred at low temperatures. Within this context, we review the various pathways by which redox reactions that involve organic matter can produce the observed suite of iron-, sulfur- and phosphorus-bearing minerals in laboratory and natural environments on Earth. Ultimately, we conclude that analysis of the core sample collected from this unit using high-sensitivity instrumentation on Earth will enable the measurements required to determine the origin of the minerals, organics and textures it contains. A geological, petrographic and geochemical survey of distinctive mudstone and conglomerate outcrops of the Bright Angel formation on Mars reveals textures, chemical and mineral characteristics, and organic signatures that warrant consideration as potential biosignatures. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09413-0?error=cookies_not_supported&code=a5b4b1ab-4f30-4a6e-88c0-395931742a3c |
