| health | 4 simple exercises that can help relieve foot pain from diabetic neuropathy | Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes, often marked by pain, numbness, weakness and poor foot‑ankle mobility that can seriously impair daily function and quality of life. Recent research increasingly shows that, beyond medication, targeted physical exercises for the foot, ankle and lower leg offer a promising, non‑pharmacological strategy to support nerve and musculoskeletal health in people with DPN.What makes these findings especially compelling is that many of these positive effects appear even with simple, low‑intensity exercises. As such, exercise emerges not as a cure, but as a practical, accessible and evidence‑supported component of neuropathy self‑care. | https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/fitness/4-simple-exercises-that-can-help-relieve-foot-pain-from-diabetic-neuropathy/photostory/125640973.cms |
