| health | Correlates of HIV-1 control after combination immunotherapy | The identification of therapeutic strategies to induce sustained antiretroviral therapy (ART)-free control of HIV infection is a major priority.1 Combination immunotherapy including HIV vaccination, immune stimulation/latency reversal, and passive transfer of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) has shown promise in non-human primate models,2–6 but few studies have translated such approaches into people. We performed a single-arm, proof-of-concept study in ten people with HIV on ART combining the following three approaches: (1) therapeutic vaccination with an HIV/Gag conserved element (CE)-targeted DNA+IL-12 prime/MVA boost regimen followed by (2) administration of two bNAbs (10-1074, VRC07-523LS) and a toll-like receptor 9 agonist (lefitolimod) during ART suppression, followed by (3) repeat bNAb administration at the time of ART interruption (NCT04357821). Seven of the ten participants exhibited post-intervention control after stopping ART, independent of residual bNAb plasma levels. Robust expansion of activated CD8+ T cells early in response to rebounding virus correlated with lower median viral load following peak viremia off ART. These data suggest that combination immunotherapy approaches might prove effective to induce sustained control of HIV by slowing rebound and improving CD8+ T cell responses, and that these approaches should continue to be optimized. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09929-5?error=cookies_not_supported&code=349f729c-b5a2-4f81-ace2-bcb94a14926b |
| health | Sustained HIV-1 remission after heterozygous CCR5Δ32 stem cell transplantation | HIV cure is exceptionally rare, documented in only six cases among the estimated 88 million individuals who have acquired HIV since the epidemic's onset1–6. Successful cures, including the pioneering Berlin patient, are limited to individuals receiving allogeneic stem cell transplants (allo-SCT) for hematological cancers. HIV resistance from stem cell donors with the rare homozygous CCR5 Δ32 mutation was long considered the main mechanism for HIV remission without antiretroviral therapy (ART), but recent reports highlight CCR5-independent mechanisms as important contributors to HIV cure6–8. Here, we provide new evidence for this conceptual shift, reporting exceptionally long, treatment-free HIV remission following allo-SCT with functionally active CCR5. A heterozygous CCR5 wild-type/Δ32 male living with HIV received allo-SCT from an HLA-matched unrelated heterozygous CCR5 wild-type/Δ32 donor as treatment for acute myeloid leukemia. Three years after allo-SCT, the patient discontinued ART. To date, HIV remission has been sustained for over six years with undetectable plasma HIV RNA. Reservoir analysis revealed intact proviral HIV before transplantation, but no replication-competent virus in blood or intestinal tissues after allo-SCT. Declining or absent HIV-specific antibody and T cell responses support the absence of viral activity. High antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity at the time of transplantation may have contributed to HIV reservoir clearance. These results demonstrate that CCR5Δ32-mediated HIV resistance is not essential for durable remission, underscoring the importance of effective viral reservoir reductions in HIV cure strategies. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09893-0?error=cookies_not_supported&code=10fbc75d-cae9-4a88-8bd0-0285e96768a7 |
