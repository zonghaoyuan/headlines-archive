| science | Evidence of neolithic cannibalism among farming communities at El Mirador cave, Sierra de Atapuerca, Spain | In El Mirador cave in Sierra de Atapuerca, Spain, a unique collection of human remains provides insights into cannibalistic practices from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age. Six Early Bronze Age individuals (4600–4100 cal BP) showing signs of cannibalism were discovered in the early 2000s. Later excavations uncovered older remains with similar cultural modifications. A Bayesian statistical analysis of the radiocarbon dates identified a single earlier event (5709–5573 cal BP) unrelated to the Bronze Age finds. 87Sr/86Sr analysis showed the cannibalised people were of local origin. The episode coincided with the end of the Neolithic occupation, suggesting this was a not common behaviour among the cave inhabitants. Given the age of the cannibalised individuals and environmental conditions, the data does not indicate a response to famine. This study complements and expands upon our understanding of European prehistoric cannibalism. The current findings suggest that cannibalism may be linked to intergroup violence during late prehistoric periods. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-10266-w?error=cookies_not_supported&code=1d11b621-748e-4513-a2cf-e3047261c5b7 |
