| science | Patchy nanoparticles by atomic stencilling | Stencilling, in which patterns are created by painting over masks, has ubiquitous applications in art, architecture and manufacturing. Modern, top-down microfabrication methods have succeeded in reducing mask sizes to under 10 nm (refs. 1,2), enabling ever smaller microdevices as today’s fastest computer chips. Meanwhile, bottom-up masking using chemical bonds or physical interactions has remained largely unexplored, despite its advantages of low cost, solution-processability, scalability and high compatibility with complex, curved and three-dimensional (3D) surfaces3,4. Here we report atomic stencilling to make patchy nanoparticles (NPs), using surface-adsorbed iodide submonolayers to create the mask and ligand-mediated grafted polymers onto unmasked regions as ‘paint’. We use this approach to synthesize more than 20 different types of NP coated with polymer patches in high yield. Polymer scaling theory and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation show that stencilling, along with the interplay of enthalpic and entropic effects of polymers, generates patchy particle morphologies not reported previously. These polymer-patched NPs self-assemble into extended crystals owing to highly uniform patches, including different non-closely packed superlattices. We propose that atomic stencilling opens new avenues in patterning NPs and other substrates at the nanometre length scale, leading to precise control of their chemistry, reactivity and interactions for a wide range of applications, such as targeted delivery, catalysis, microelectronics, integrated metamaterials and tissue engineering5–11. An atomic stencilling method based on the co-adsorption of iodide and 2-naphthalenethiol on gold is described, yielding more than 20 different types of nanoparticle with masked and painted regions and patchy particle morphologies not reported previously. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09605-8?error=cookies_not_supported&code=68d173f9-d2e1-4f41-8d7c-381d0d6e8c02 |
| science | Photocatalytic oxygen-atom transmutation of oxetanes | Non-aromatic heterocycles and carbocycles form the skeleton of countless bioactive and functional molecules1,2. Of note, four-membered saturated cyclic molecules such as azetidines, thietanes and cyclobutanes have garnered increasing attention in medicinal chemistry3-7. These molecules often possess physicochemical properties relevant to drug discovery: potency, stability, metabolic stability and target specificity3. The replacement of oxygen atoms in readily available oxetanes would offer a direct route to a variety of these cyclic pharmacophores, yet such atom swapping has been rarely reported for non-aromatic molecules. Here we report a general photocatalytic strategy that selectively substitutes the oxygen atom of an oxetane with a nitrogen-, sulfur- or carbon-based moiety, transforming it into a diverse range of saturated cyclic building blocks in a single operation. This atom swapping method exhibits high functional group compatibility and is applicable to late-stage functionalization, substantially simplifying the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and complex drug analogues that would otherwise require multi-step routes. Mechanistic investigations unveil insights on the origin of chemoselectivity that allows the endocyclic oxygen atom to react preferentially to generate an acyclic dihalide intermediate, which then undergoes efficient ring reconstruction in the presence of a nucleophilic species. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09723-3?error=cookies_not_supported&code=feaef35f-a625-4331-be2e-5d7b579ea0d2 |
| science | In-plane dielectric constant and conductivity of confined water | Water is essential for almost every aspect of life on our planet and, unsurprisingly, its properties have been studied in great detail1. However, disproportionately little remains known about the electrical properties of interfacial and strongly confined water2,3, in which the structure deviates from that of bulk water, becoming distinctly layered4,5. The structural change is expected to affect the conductivity of water and particularly its polarizability, which in turn modifies intermolecular forces that play a crucial role in many physical and chemical processes6–9. Here we use scanning dielectric microscopy (SDM)10 to probe the in-plane electrical properties of water confined between atomically flat surfaces separated by distances down to 1 nm. For confinement exceeding several nanometres, water exhibits an in-plane dielectric constant close to that of bulk water and its proton conductivity is notably enhanced, gradually increasing with decreasing water thickness. This trend abruptly changes when the confined water becomes only a few molecules thick. Its in-plane dielectric constant reaches large, ferroelectric-like values of about 1,000, whereas the conductivity peaks at several S m−1, close to values characteristic of superionic liquids. We attribute the enhancement to strongly disordered hydrogen bonding induced by the few-layer confinement, which facilitates both easier in-plane polarization of molecular dipoles and faster proton exchange. This insight into the electrical properties of nanoconfined water is important for understanding many phenomena that occur at aqueous interfaces and in nanoscale pores. Scanning dielectric microscopy of nanocapillaries filled with water reveals that interfacial and strongly confined water exhibits a large in-plane dielectric constant and an in-plane conductivity approaching superionic values. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09558-y?error=cookies_not_supported&code=e11b9d86-627c-4b62-b3d0-082aca8610b7 |
