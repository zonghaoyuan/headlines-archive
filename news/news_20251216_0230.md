| health | AIIMS study finds heart disease as the leading cause of sudden death in people under 45: 5 ‘unusual’ warning signs you should pay attention to | Turns out, you are never too young to fall prey to heart disease nowadays.A new AIIMS study has brought in a major health alert for India and the world: Heart disease has become the leading cause of sudden death among people in the age group of 18 to 45. Once considered an older person's disease, cardiovascular causes are striking younger adults who often appear healthy just moments before collapsing suddenly.In a one-year autopsy-based study from AIIMS, it was found that more than half of all sudden deaths in this age group were due to heart-related problems, the major killers being CAD along with other cardiovascular conditions. Sudden loss of consciousness was the most common symptom before death, often leaving families in shock.The particular report carries much significance, as it advocates for a better level of awareness regarding heart disease, especially in seemingly healthy persons. The early recognition of subtle and atypical warning signs can save lives. Whereas the classic symptoms of a heart attack, like sharp chest pain, are well-known to all, in many young adults, these atypical warning signs do not appear serious on the face of it. Early detection and timely intervention make all the difference — it saves lives. | https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/aiims-study-finds-heart-disease-as-the-leading-cause-of-sudden-death-in-people-under-45-5-unusual-warning-signs-you-should-pay-attention-to/photostory/125969976.cms |
