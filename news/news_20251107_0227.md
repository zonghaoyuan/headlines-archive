| science | Two residues reprogram immunity receptors for nitrogen-fixing symbiosis | Receptor signalling determines cellular responses and is crucial for defining specific biological outcomes. In legume root cells, highly similar and structurally conserved chitin and Nod factor receptor kinases activate immune or symbiotic pathways, respectively, when chitinous ligands are perceived1. Here we show that specific amino acid residues in the intracellular part of the Nod factor receptor NFR1 control signalling specificity and enable the distinction of immune and symbiotic responses. Functional investigation of CERK6, NFR1 and receptor variants thereof revealed a conserved motif that we term Symbiosis Determinant 1 in the juxtamembrane region of the kinase domain, which is key for symbiotic signalling. We show that two residues in Symbiosis Determinant 1 are indispensable hallmarks of NFR1-type receptors and are sufficient to convert Lotus CERK6 and barley RLK4 kinase outputs to enable symbiotic signalling in Lotus japonicus. An investigation of plant receptor-like kinases identifies regions of these proteins that control whether immune or symbiotic signalling pathways are activated, with minimal changes to specific residues in one of these regions being sufficient to alter signalling specificity. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09696-3?error=cookies_not_supported&code=49658ef3-9bf0-467f-9d91-d37c3d6ef1dd |
