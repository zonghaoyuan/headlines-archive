| health | Connectivity underlying motor cortex activity during goal-directed behaviour | Neural representations of information are shaped by long-range input and local network interactions. Previous studies linking neural coding and cortical connectivity have focused on input-driven activity in the sensory cortex1–3. Here we studied neural activity in the motor cortex while mice gathered rewards with multidirectional tongue reaching. This behaviour does not require training, allowing us to probe neural coding and connectivity before activity is shaped by extended learning. Motor cortex neurons were tuned to target location and reward outcome, and typically responded during and after movements. We studied the underlying network interactions in vivo by estimating causal neural connections using an all-optical method3–6. Mapping connectivity between more than 20,000,000 excitatory neuron pairs showed a multi-scale columnar architecture in layer 2/3 of the motor cortex. Neurons displayed local (less than 100 µm) like-to-like excitatory connectivity according to target-location tuning, and inhibition over longer spatial scales. Connectivity patterns comprised a continuum, with abundant sparsely connected neurons and rare densely connected neurons that function as network hubs. Hub neurons were weakly tuned to target location and reward outcome but influenced more neighbouring neurons. This network of neurons, encoding location and outcome of movements to different motor goals, may be a general substrate for rapid learning of complex, goal-directed behaviours. All-optical mapping of neural connectivity in motor cortex links network topology to network dynamics and computation underlying naturalistic goal-directed behaviour. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09758-6?error=cookies_not_supported&code=95287cfd-567d-4fc2-ac46-0285ca6cf4b2 |

These failures are the result of the anti-vaccination movement, bolstered by the appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — and it's a bellwether of the erosion of public health. | https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/us-is-on-track-to-lose-its-measles-elimination-status-in-months-rfk-needs-to-go-opinion |

| health | Prime editing-installed suppressor tRNAs for disease-agnostic genome editing | Precise genome-editing technologies such as base editing1,2 and prime editing3 can correct most pathogenic gene variants, but their widespread clinical application is impeded by the need to develop new therapeutic agents for each mutation. For diseases that are caused by premature stop codons, suppressor tRNAs (sup-tRNAs) offer a more general strategy. Existing approaches to use sup-tRNAs therapeutically, however, require lifelong administration4,5 or show modest potency, necessitating potentially toxic overexpression. Here we present prime editing-mediated readthrough of premature termination codons (PERT), a strategy to rescue nonsense mutations in a disease-agnostic manner by using prime editing to permanently convert a dispensable endogenous tRNA into an optimized sup-tRNA. Iterative screening of thousands of variants of all 418 human tRNAs identified tRNAs with the strongest sup-tRNA potential. We optimized prime editing agents to install an engineered sup-tRNA at a single genomic locus without overexpression and observed efficient readthrough of premature termination codons and protein rescue in human cell models of Batten disease, Tay–Sachs disease and cystic fibrosis. In vivo delivery of a single prime editor that converts an endogenous mouse tRNA into a sup-tRNA extensively rescued disease pathology in a model of Hurler syndrome. PERT did not induce detected readthrough of natural stop codons or cause significant transcriptomic or proteomic changes. Our findings suggest the potential of disease-agnostic therapeutic genome-editing approaches that require only a single composition of matter to treat diverse genetic diseases. A new strategy that uses prime editing to convert an endogenous tRNA into a suppressor tRNA shows therapeutic potential for multiple genetic diseases that are caused by premature stop codons. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09732-2?error=cookies_not_supported&code=62d3e971-ae3a-4f81-9c90-a7ebd6f7cf93 |
| health | Integrator dynamics in the cortico-basal ganglia loop for flexible motor timing | Flexible control of motor timing is crucial for behaviour1–4. Before volitional movement begins, the frontal cortex and striatum exhibit ramping spiking activity, with variable ramp slopes anticipating movement onsets5–12. This activity in the cortico-basal ganglia loop may function as an adjustable ‘timer,’ triggering actions at the desired timing. However, because the frontal cortex and striatum share similar ramping dynamics and are both necessary for timing behaviours, distinguishing their individual roles in this timer function remains challenging. Here, to address this, we conducted perturbation experiments combined with multi-regional electrophysiology in mice performing a flexible lick-timing task. Following transient silencing of the frontal cortex, cortical and striatal activity swiftly returned to pre-silencing levels and resumed ramping, leading to a shift in lick timing close to the silencing duration. Conversely, briefly inhibiting the striatum caused a gradual decrease in ramping activity in both regions, with ramping resuming from post-inhibition levels, shifting lick timing beyond the inhibition duration. Thus, inhibiting the frontal cortex and striatum effectively paused and rewound the timer, respectively. These findings are consistent with a model in which the striatum is part of a network that temporally integrates input from the frontal cortex and generates ramping activity that regulates motor timing. How the mouse frontal cortex and striatum interact to implement integrator dynamics controlling movement timing is explored. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09778-2?error=cookies_not_supported&code=0b3f2613-2cec-4cf6-9ec3-e68eca4471b4 |
