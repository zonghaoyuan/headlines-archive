| science | Probing quantum mechanics with nanoparticle matter-wave interferometry | The quantum superposition principle is a fundamental concept of physics1 and the basis of numerous quantum technologies2,3. Yet, it is still often regarded counterintuitive because we do not observe its key features on the macroscopic scales of our daily lives. It is, therefore, interesting to ask how quantum properties persist or change as we increase the size and complexity of objects4. A model test for this question can be realized by matter-wave interferometry, in which the motion of individual massive particles becomes delocalized and needs to be described by a wave function that spans regions far larger than the particle itself5. Over the years, this has been explored with a series of objects of increasing mass and complexity6–9 and a growing community aims at pushing this to ever larger limits. Here we present an experimental platform that extends matter-wave interference to large metal clusters, a qualitatively new material class for quantum experiments. We specifically demonstrate quantum interference of sodium nanoparticles, which can each contain more than 7,000 atoms at masses greater than 170,000 Da. They propagate in a Schrödinger cat state with a macroscopicity10 of μ = 15.5, surpassing previous experiments5,9,11 by an order of magnitude. Quantum interference of sodium nanoparticles, which can each contain more than 7,000 atoms at masses greater than 170,000 Da, is demonstrated. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09917-9?error=cookies_not_supported&code=2dacee98-e696-47cc-a754-5b3a8023e167 |

| health | Pyramidal neurons proportionately alter cortical interneuron subtypes | The mammalian cerebral cortex comprises a complex neuronal network that maintains a precise balance between excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. Accumulating evidence indicates that specific interneuron subtypes form stereotyped microcircuits with distinct pyramidal neuron classes1–3. Here we show that pyramidal neurons have an active role in this process by promoting the survival and terminal differentiation of their associated interneuron subtypes. In the wild-type cortex, interneuron subtype abundance mirrors the prevalence of their pyramidal neuron partners. In Fezf2 mutants, which lack L5b pyramidal neurons and are expanded in L6 intratelencephalic neurons, corresponding subtype-specific shifts occur through two distinct mechanisms: somatostatin interneurons adjust their programmed cell death, whereas parvalbumin interneurons switch their subtype identity. Silencing neuronal activity or blocking vesicular release in L5b pyramidal neurons revealed that their communication with interneurons does not require voltage-gated synaptic activity but engages both tetanus toxin-sensitive and tetanus toxin-insensitive pathways. Moreover, a targeted bioinformatic screen for ligand–receptor pairs displaying subtype-specific expression and reduced expression of pyramidal neuron-derived ligand in Fezf2 mutants identified candidate secreted factors and adhesion molecules. These findings reveal distinct, pyramidal neuron-driven mechanisms for sculpting interneuron diversity and integrating them into local cortical circuits. Pyramidal neuron-driven mechanisms actively promote the survival and terminal differentiation of their associated interneuron subtypes. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09996-8?error=cookies_not_supported&code=7591fa58-5692-49cd-93ff-7ba35c48ee0d |

| health | Common variation in meiosis genes shapes human recombination and aneuploidy | The leading cause of human pregnancy loss is aneuploidy, often tracing to errors in chromosome segregation during female meiosis1,2. Although abnormal crossover recombination is known to confer risk for aneuploidy3,4, limited data have hindered understanding of the potential shared genetic basis of these key molecular phenotypes. To address this gap, we performed retrospective analysis of pre-implantation genetic testing data from 139,416 in vitro fertilized embryos from 22,850 sets of biological parents. By tracing transmission of haplotypes, we identified 3,809,412 crossovers, as well as 92,485 aneuploid chromosomes. Counts of crossovers were lower in aneuploid versus euploid embryos, consistent with their role in chromosome pairing and segregation. Our analyses further revealed that a common haplotype spanning the meiotic cohesin SMC1B is associated significantly with both crossover count and maternal meiotic aneuploidy, with evidence supporting a non-coding cis-regulatory mechanism. Transcriptome- and phenome-wide association tests also implicated variation in the synaptonemal complex component C14orf39 and crossover-regulating ubiquitin ligases CCNB1IP1 and RNF212 in meiotic aneuploidy risk. More broadly, variants associated with aneuploidy often showed secondary associations with recombination, and several also exhibited associations with reproductive ageing traits. Our findings highlight the dual role of recombination in generating genetic diversity, while ensuring meiotic fidelity. Analysis of data from pre-implantation genetic testing sheds light on the genetic basis of meiotic-origin aneuploidy, the leading cause of human pregnancy loss, identifying common genetic variants associated with maternal meiotic errors. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09964-2?error=cookies_not_supported&code=c37bf313-7ace-4826-b279-092ee04ccac9 |
