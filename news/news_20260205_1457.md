| science | Imaging a terahertz superfluid plasmon in a two-dimensional superconductor | The superconducting gap defines the fundamental energy scale for the emergence of dissipationless transport and collective phenomena in a superconductor1–3. In layered high-temperature cuprate superconductors, in which the Cooper pairs are confined to weakly coupled two-dimensional (2D) copper–oxygen (CuO2) planes4,5, terahertz (THz) spectroscopy at subgap millielectronvolt (meV) energies has provided crucial insights into the collective superfluid response perpendicular to the superconducting layers6–9. However, within the CuO2 planes, the collective superfluid response manifests as plasmonic charge oscillations at energies far exceeding the superconducting gap, obscured by strong dissipation2,6,9,10. Here we present spectroscopic evidence of a below-gap, 2D superfluid plasmon in few-layer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x and spatially resolve its deeply subdiffractive THz electrodynamics. By placing the superconductor in the near field of a spintronic THz emitter, we reveal this distinct resonance—absent in bulk samples and observed only in the superconducting phase—and determine its plasmonic nature by mapping the geometric anisotropy and dispersion. Crucially, these measurements offer a direct view of the momentum-dependent and frequency-dependent superconducting transition in two dimensions. Terahertz microspectroscopic imaging at subgap millielectronvolt energies of a two-dimensional superfluid plasmon in few-layer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x is demonstrated, allowing the spatial resolution of its deeply subdiffractive terahertz electrodynamics. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-10082-2?error=cookies_not_supported&code=24c9e348-6e2b-4c72-b8e7-c679788aa49e |

| health | Parkinson’s disease as a somato-cognitive action network disorder | Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an incurable neurological disorder that often begins insidiously with sleep disturbances and somatic symptoms, progressing to whole-body motor and cognitive symptoms1–5. Dysfunction of the somato-cognitive action network (SCAN)—which is thought to control action execution6,7 by coordinating arousal, organ physiology and whole-body motor plans with behavioural motivation—is a potential contributor to the diverse clinical manifestations of PD. To investigate the role of the SCAN in PD pathophysiology and treatments (medications, deep-brain stimulation (DBS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and MRI-guided focused ultrasound stimulation (MRgFUS)), we built a large (n = 863), multimodal, multi-intervention clinical imaging dataset. Resting-state functional connectivity revealed that the substantia nigra and all PD DBS targets (subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus and ventral intermediate thalamus) are selectively connected to the SCAN rather than to effector-specific motor regions. Importantly, PD was characterized by specific hyperconnectivity between the SCAN and the subcortex. We therefore followed six PD cohorts undergoing DBS, TMS, MRgFUS and levodopa therapy using precision resting-state functional connectivity and electrocorticography recording. Efficacious treatments reduced SCAN-to-subcortex hyperconnectivity. Targeting the SCAN instead of effector regions doubled the efficacy of TMS treatments. Focused ultrasound treatment benefits increased when the target was closer to the thalamic SCAN sweet spot. Thus, SCAN hyperconnectivity is central to PD pathophysiology and its alleviation is a hallmark of successful neuromodulation. Targeting functionally defined subcortical SCAN nodes may improve existing therapies (DBS, MRgFUS), whereas cortical SCAN targets offer effective non-invasive or minimally invasive neuromodulation for PD. The substantia nigra and all Parkinson’s disease deep-brain stimulation targets are selectively connected to the somato-cognitive action network rather than to effector-specific motor regions. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-10059-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=773e8f47-7ec5-4cde-b135-476b2842ae08 |
