| science | Ancient co-option of LTR retrotransposons as yeast centromeres | Centromeres ensure accurate chromosome segregation, yet their DNA evolves rapidly across eukaryotes leaving the origins of new centromere architectures unclear1–4. The brewer’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae exemplifies this long-standing puzzle. Its centromeres shifted ancestrally from large, repeat-rich, epigenetically specified forms to the compact, genetically defined ‘point’ centromeres1,5. How this transition occurred has remained unresolved6. Here we identify evolutionarily related ‘proto-point’ centromeres that provide a resolution to the evolutionary origins of point centromeres. Proto-point centromeres contain a single centromeric nucleosome positioned over an AT-rich core, accompanied by relaxed organization and sequence variability of flanking cis-elements. In two species, these proto-point centromeres lie within retrotransposon-derived repeat clusters, linking ancestral repeat-rich centromeres to genetically encoded ones. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses indicate that proto-point and point centromeres evolved in an ancestor with retrotransposon-rich centromeres. These results identify long-terminal-repeat retrotransposons, specifically Ty5 sequences, as the genetic substrate for point-centromere evolution and provide a mechanistic route by which an epigenetic centromere can become genetically specified. More broadly, they show how selfish elements can be co-opted to perform essential chromosomal functions. Evolutionarily related ‘proto-point’ centromeres providing resolution to the evolutionary origins of point centromeres are identified in yeast, and comparison shows they evolved in an ancestor with retrotransposon-rich centromeres and that long-terminal-repeat retrotransposons are the genetic substrate. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-10092-0?error=cookies_not_supported&code=29da50e5-0459-4cb6-ab46-39f851883e6f |

| health | Single-cell and isoform-specific translational profiling of the mouse brain | The brain displays the richest repertoire of post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating mRNA translation1–11. Among these, alternative splicing has been shown to drive cell-type specificity and, when disrupted, is strongly linked to neurological disorders12–17. However, genome-wide measurements of mRNA translation with isoform sensitivity at single-cell resolution have not been achieved. To address this, we deployed Surveying Ribosomal Targets by APOBEC-Mediated Profiling (Ribo-STAMP) coupled with short-read and long-read single-cell RNA sequencing in the brain18. We generated the first isoform-sensitive single-cell translatomes of the mouse hippocampus at postnatal day 25, discovering cell-type-specific translation of 3,857 alternative transcripts across 1,641 genes and identifying isoforms of the same genes undergoing differential translation within and across 8 different cell types. We defined high and low translational states in CA1 and CA3 neurons, with synaptic and metabolic genes enriched in high states. We found that CA3 exhibited higher basal translation compared with CA1, as confirmed by metabolic labelling of newly synthesized proteins and immunohistochemistry of translational machinery components. This accessible platform will expand our understanding of how cell-type-specific and isoform-specific translation drives brain physiology and disease. Post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA translation was explored using Ribo-STAMP and single-cell RNA sequencing to reveal cell-type-specific and isoform-specific translation patterns across hippocampal neuronal and non-neuronal cell types, highlighting functional differences between CA1 and CA3. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-026-10118-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=76f389b5-793f-4a87-a396-e70f0abb0ec5 |
