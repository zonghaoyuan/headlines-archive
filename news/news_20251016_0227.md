| health | Vitamin D toxicity: Hidden dangers, signs, and symptoms, and how to reverse it safely and naturally | As the saying goes: Every sunshine comes with its fair share of rain.Vitamin D, which has long been celebrated as the “sunshine vitamin” — vital for bone health, immune support, mood regulation, and more – is no exception.Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium and phosphorus, both vital for bone strength. Doctors often recommend supplements, especially when people don’t get enough sun or dietary sources. However, just as with many good things, too much vitamin D can have adverse effects. Vitamin D toxicity – also called hypervitaminosis D – is a lesser-known but serious condition. In many cases, people take high-dose supplements for months or years without realizing the risks.Vitamin D toxicity (especially via supplements) occurs when vitamin D levels rise excessively, causing dangerous side effects – triggering a dangerous rise in blood calcium and affecting organs like the kidneys, heart, and brain.While vitamin D deficiency is common, toxicity is rare—and often preventable with careful use. Here, we’ll explore the hidden dangers, signs and symptoms, and medical and natural ways to reverse vitamin D toxicity safely.
