| science | Extremely stripped supernova reveals a silicon and sulfur formation site | Stars are initially powered by the fusion of hydrogen to helium. These ashes serve as fuel in a series of stages1–3, transforming massive stars into a structure of shells. These are composed of natal hydrogen on the outside and consecutively heavier compositions inside, predicted to be dominated by He, C/O, O/Ne/Mg and O/Si/S (refs. 4,5). Silicon and sulfur are fused into iron, leading to the collapse of the core and either a supernova explosion or the formation of a black hole6–9. Stripped stars, in which the outer hydrogen layer has been removed and the internal He-rich or even the C/O layer below it is exposed10, provide evidence for this shell structure and the cosmic element production mechanism it reflects. The supernova types that arise from stripped stars embedded in shells of circumstellar material (CSM) confirm this scenario11–15. However, direct evidence for the most interior shells, which are responsible for producing elements heavier than oxygen, is lacking. Here we report the discovery of the supernova (SN) 2021yfj resulting from a star stripped to its O/Si/S-rich layer. We directly observe a thick, massive Si/S-rich shell, expelled by the progenitor shortly before the supernova explosion. Exposing such an inner stellar layer is theoretically challenging and probably requires a rarely observed mass-loss mechanism. This rare supernova event reveals advanced stages of stellar evolution, forming heavier elements, including silicon, sulfur and argon, than those detected on the surface of any known class of massive stars. Observations of SN 2021yfj reveal that its progenitor is a massive star stripped down to its O/Si/S core, which remarkably continued to expel vast quantities of silicon-, sulfur-, and argon-rich material before the explosion, informing us that current theories for how stars evolve are too narrow. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09375-3?error=cookies_not_supported&code=9db4ae7b-52d3-4455-95c0-e4b86d8e634c |
| science | Electrochemical loading enhances deuterium fusion rates in a metal target | Nuclear fusion research for energy applications aims to create conditions that release more energy than required to initiate the fusion process1. To generate meaningful amounts of energy, fuels such as deuterium need to be spatially confined to increase the collision probability of particles2–4. We therefore set out to investigate whether electrochemically loading a metal lattice with deuterium fuel could increase the probability of nuclear fusion events. Here we report a benchtop fusion reactor that enabled us to bombard a palladium metal target with deuterium ions. These deuterium ions undergo deuterium–deuterium fusion reactions within the palladium metal. We showed that the in situ electrochemical loading of deuterium into the palladium target resulted in a 15(2)% increase in deuterium–deuterium fusion rates. This experiment shows how the electrochemical loading of a metal target at the electronvolt energy scale can affect nuclear reactions at the megaelectronvolt energy scale. A benchtop fusion reactor, called the Thunderbird Reactor, is described, showing that electrochemically loading a metal lattice with deuterium could enhance nuclear fusion rates when that metal is also bombarded by deuterium ions. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09042-7?error=cookies_not_supported&code=9090a6f0-7f26-4efc-b4ee-bd4c69b28798 |
