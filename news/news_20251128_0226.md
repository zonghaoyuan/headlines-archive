In recordings obtained by NASA's Perseverance rover, scientists have identified, for the first time, electrical discharges captured during Mars's wild dust events and whirling dust devils – not once, but 55 times over two Martian years of observation. | https://www.sciencealert.com/nasa-recorded-lightning-crackling-on-mars-for-the-first-time |
| science | Detection of triboelectric discharges during dust events on Mars | Lightning is among the most energetic manifestation of electrical activity in planetary atmospheres, with documented observations not only on Earth but also on Saturn and Jupiter1. On Mars, the existence of electrical activity has long been suspected2,3 but never directly demonstrated. The dusty atmosphere of Mars undergoes aeolian processes, ranging from wind-blown dust and sand, metre-to-hundred-metre-sized dust devils to thousand-kilometre-scale dust storms4, which, in Earth’s deserts, can become electrified through triboelectric charging5–7. For this reason, electric fields have been predicted to build up on Mars8–10, but with no measurement of Martian atmospheric electrical activity so far. Here we report in situ detections of triboelectric discharges, identified by their electrical and acoustic signatures captured by the SuperCam microphone aboard the Perseverance rover11,12. Fifty-five events have been detected over two Martian years, usually associated with dust devils and dust storm convective fronts. These serendipitous observations demonstrate that Martian electric fields can reach the breakdown threshold of the near-surface atmosphere of Mars, predicted to be on the order of several tens of kV m−1. Such electrical activity could affect dust dynamics13,14 and potentially fuel a reactive electrochemical environment enhancing the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere, with consequences for the preservation of organic molecules15,16. This in situ evidence may have implications for surface chemistry, habitability and human exploration. The SuperCam microphone aboard the Perseverance rover captured 55 triboelectric discharges during dust events on Mars over two Martian years, providing implications for examining the planet’s surface chemistry, habitability and human exploration. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09736-y?error=cookies_not_supported&code=37b1a66a-03fc-4d37-9773-476ac78c8aa6 |
| science | Multi-qubit nanoscale sensing with entanglement as a resource | Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centres in diamond are widely deployed as local magnetic sensors, using single-qubit control to measure both time-averaged fields and noise with nanoscale spatial resolution1. Moving beyond single qubits to multi-qubit control enables new sensing modalities such as measuring nonlocal spatiotemporal correlators2 or using entangled states to enhance measurement sensitivity3. Here we describe protocols for using optically unresolved NV centre pairs and nuclear spins as multi-qubit sensors for measuring correlated noise at nanometre length scales. For noninteracting NV centres, we implement a phase-cycling protocol that disambiguates magnetic correlations from variance fluctuations, leveraging the presence of a third qubit, a 13C nucleus, to effect coherent single-NV spin flips and enable phase cycling even for co-aligned NV centres that are spectrally unresolved. For length scales around 10 nm, we create maximally entangled Bell states through dipole–dipole coupling between two NV centres and use these entangled states to directly read out the magnetic field correlation, rather than reconstructing it from independent measurements of unentangled NV centres. Importantly, this changes the scaling of sensitivity with readout noise from quadratic to linear. For conventional off-resonant readout of the NV centre spin state (for which the readout noise is roughly 30 times the quantum projection limit), this results in more than an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity. Finally, we demonstrate methods for detecting high spatial- and temporal-resolution correlators with pairs of strongly interacting NV centres. Controlling pairs of nitrogen vacancy centres enables the measurement of magnetic correlations below the optical diffraction limit, and the use of entangled pairs shows a linear scaling of the measurement sensitivity with readout noise, as opposed to the quadratic scaling that would be obtained with unentangled spins. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09760-y?error=cookies_not_supported&code=56b1e9a0-d9e8-4475-9c13-167364416227 |
