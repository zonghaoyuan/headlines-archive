| science | A human-specific regulatory mechanism revealed in a pre-implantation model | Stem cell-based human embryo models offer a unique opportunity for functional studies of the human-specific features of development. Here we genetically and epigenetically manipulate human blastoids, a 3D embryo model of the blastocyst1, to investigate the functional effect of HERVK LTR5Hs, a hominoid-specific endogenous retrovirus, on pre-implantation development. We uncover a pervasive cis-regulatory contribution of LTR5Hs elements to the hominoid-specific diversification of the epiblast transcriptome in blastoids. Many of the LTR5Hs genomic insertions in the human genome are unique to our own species. We show that at least one such human-specific LTR5Hs element is essential for the blastoid-forming potential via enhancing expression of the primate-specific ZNF729 gene, encoding a KRAB zinc-finger protein. ZNF729 binds to GC-rich sequences, abundant at gene promoters associated with basic cellular functions, such as cell proliferation and metabolism. Despite mediating recruitment of TRIM28, at many of these promoters ZNF729 acts as a transcriptional activator. Together, our results illustrate how recently emerged transposable elements and genes can confer developmentally essential functions in humans. Genetic manipulation of blastoids reveals the role of recently emerged transposable elements and genes in human development. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09571-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=f0f70b86-b565-4e63-920c-1c8077f1a5dd |

| science | Detection of organic compounds in freshly ejected ice grains from Enceladus’s ocean | Saturn’s moon Enceladus ejects a plume of ice grains and gases originating from a subsurface ocean via fractures near its south pole. The chemical characterization of organic material in such ice grains was previously conducted via the analysis of mass spectra obtained in Saturn’s E ring by Cassini’s Cosmic Dust Analyzer at impact speeds below 12 km s−1. Here we present a comprehensive chemical analysis of organic-bearing ice grains sampled directly from the plume during a Cassini fly-by of Enceladus (E5) at an encounter speed of nearly 18 km s−1. We again detect aryl and oxygen moieties in these fresh ice grains, as previously identified in older E-ring grains. Furthermore, the unprecedented high encounter speed revealed previously unobserved molecular fragments in Cosmic Dust Analyzer spectra, allowing the identification of aliphatic, (hetero)cyclic ester/alkenes, ethers/ethyl and, tentatively, N- and O-bearing compounds. These freshly ejected species are derived from the Enceladus subsurface, hinting at a hydrothermal origin and involvement in geochemical pathways towards the synthesis and evolution of organics. Fresh ice grains from Enceladus’s plume were analysed during the highest-speed fly-by of the Cassini spacecraft.

| science | Cassini proves complex chemistry in Enceladus ocean | Scientists digging through data collected by the Cassini spacecraft have found new complex organic molecules spewing from Saturn’s moon Enceladus. This is a clear sign that complex chemical reactions are taking place within its underground ocean. Some of these reactions could be part of chains that lead to even more complex, potentially biologically relevant molecules.Published today in Nature Astronomy, this discovery further strengthens the case for a dedicated European Space Agency (ESA) mission to orbit and land on Enceladus. | https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Cassini-Huygens/Cassini_proves_complex_chemistry_in_Enceladus_ocean |

| health | A new paradigm for outer membrane protein biogenesis in the Bacteroidota | In Gram-negative bacteria, the outer membrane is the first line of defence against antimicrobial agents and immunological attacks1. A key part of outer membrane biogenesis is the insertion of outer membrane proteins by the β-barrel-assembly machinery (BAM)2–4. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a BAM complex isolated from Flavobacterium johnsoniae, a member of the Bacteroidota, a phylum that includes key human commensals and major anaerobic pathogens. This BAM complex is extensively modified from the canonical Escherichia coli system and includes an extracellular canopy that overhangs the substrate folding site and a subunit that inserts into the BAM pore. The novel BamG and BamH subunits that are involved in forming the extracellular canopy are required for BAM function and are conserved across the Bacteroidota, suggesting that they form an essential extension to the canonical BAM core in this phylum. For BamH, isolation of a suppressor mutation enables the separation of its essential and non-essential functions. The need for a highly remodelled and enhanced BAM complex reflects the unusually complex membrane proteins found in the outer membrane of the Bacteroidota. Structural and biochemical studies of the β-barrel-assembly machinery from Flavobacterium johnsoniae reveal a subunit composition and assembly that are distinct from those of the canonical Escherichia coli complex. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09532-8?error=cookies_not_supported&code=4b237fcd-c55d-4bff-9e32-5895249afb7d |
| health | Tracking clonal evolution during treatment in ovarian cancer using cell-free DNA | Emergence of drug resistance is the main cause of therapeutic failure in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC)1. To study drug resistance in patients, we developed CloneSeq-SV, which combines single-cell whole-genome sequencing2 with targeted deep sequencing of clone-specific genomic structural variants in time-series cell-free DNA. CloneSeq-SV exploits tumour clone-specific structural variants as highly sensitive endogenous cell-free DNA markers, enabling the relative abundance measurements and evolutionary analysis of co-existing clonal populations over the therapeutic time course. Here, using this approach, we studied 18 patients with HGSOC over a multi-year period from diagnosis to recurrence and showed that drug resistance typically arose from selective expansion of a single or small subset of clones present at diagnosis. Drug-resistant clones frequently showed interpretable and distinctive genomic features, including chromothripsis, whole-genome doubling, and high-level amplifications of oncogenes such as CCNE1, RAB25, MYC and NOTCH3. Phenotypic analysis of matched single-cell RNA sequencing data3 indicated pre-existing and clone-specific transcriptional states such as upregulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and VEGF pathways, linked to drug resistance. In one notable case, clone-specific ERBB2 amplification affected the efficacy of a secondary targeted therapy with a positive patient outcome. Together, our findings indicate that drug-resistant states in HGSOC pre-exist at diagnosis, leading to positive selection and reduced clonal complexity at relapse. We suggest these findings motivate investigation of evolution-informed adaptive treatment regimens to ablate drug resistance in future HGSOC studies. A combined sequencing technique assesses 18 patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer over a multi-year period from diagnosis to recurrence and shows drug resistance typically arises from selective expansion of one or a few clones present at diagnosis. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09580-0?error=cookies_not_supported&code=ce7fe5c4-9ecd-42f4-8269-3e7818f4fe89 |

| health | Dietary cysteine enhances intestinal stemness via CD8+ T cell-derived IL-22 | A fundamental question in physiology is understanding how tissues adapt and alter their cellular composition in response to dietary cues1–8. The mammalian small intestine is maintained by rapidly renewing LGR5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that respond to macronutrient changes such as fasting regimens and obesogenic diets, yet how specific amino acids control ISC function during homeostasis and injury remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that dietary cysteine, a semi-essential amino acid, enhances ISC-mediated intestinal regeneration following injury. Cysteine contributes to coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis in intestinal epithelial cells, which promotes expansion of intraepithelial CD8αβ+ T cells and their production of interleukin-22 (IL-22). This enhanced IL-22 signalling directly augments ISC reparative capacity after injury. The mechanistic involvement of the pathway in driving the effects of cysteine is demonstrated by several findings: CoA supplementation recapitulates cysteine effects, epithelial-specific loss of the cystine transporter SLC7A11 blocks the response, and mice with CD8αβ+ T cells lacking IL-22 or a depletion of CD8αβ+ T cells fail to show enhanced regeneration despite cysteine treatment. These findings highlight how coupled cysteine metabolism between ISCs and CD8+ T cells augments intestinal stemness, providing a dietary approach that exploits ISC and immune cell crosstalk for ameliorating intestinal damage. Dietary cysteine enhances intestinal stem cell-mediated intestinal repair following injury by promoting CD8 T cell-regenerative immune responses. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09589-5?error=cookies_not_supported&code=4c040596-9cd2-4c06-965f-91e0c0d9f115 |
