| science | Imaging a terahertz superfluid plasmon in a two-dimensional superconductor | The superconducting gap defines the fundamental energy scale for the emergence of dissipationless transport and collective phenomena in a superconductor1–3. In layered high-temperature cuprate superconductors, in which the Cooper pairs are confined to weakly coupled two-dimensional (2D) copper–oxygen (CuO2) planes4,5, terahertz (THz) spectroscopy at subgap millielectronvolt (meV) energies has provided crucial insights into the collective superfluid response perpendicular to the superconducting layers6–9. However, within the CuO2 planes, the collective superfluid response manifests as plasmonic charge oscillations at energies far exceeding the superconducting gap, obscured by strong dissipation2,6,9,10. Here we present spectroscopic evidence of a below-gap, 2D superfluid plasmon in few-layer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x and spatially resolve its deeply subdiffractive THz electrodynamics. By placing the superconductor in the near field of a spintronic THz emitter, we reveal this distinct resonance—absent in bulk samples and observed only in the superconducting phase—and determine its plasmonic nature by mapping the geometric anisotropy and dispersion. Crucially, these measurements offer a direct view of the momentum-dependent and frequency-dependent superconducting transition in two dimensions. Terahertz microspectroscopic imaging at subgap millielectronvolt energies of a two-dimensional superfluid plasmon in few-layer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x is demonstrated, allowing the spatial resolution of its deeply subdiffractive terahertz electrodynamics. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-10082-2?error=cookies_not_supported&code=24c9e348-6e2b-4c72-b8e7-c679788aa49e |

| science | Transient histone deacetylase inhibition induces cellular memory of gene expression and 3D genome folding | Epigenetic memory enables the propagation of gene expression patterns following transient stimuli. Although three-dimensional chromatin organization is emerging as a key regulator of genome function, it is unknown whether it contributes to cellular memory. Here we establish that acute perturbation of the epigenome can induce cellular memory of gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells. We uncover how a pulse of histone deacetylase inhibition translates to changes in transcription, histone modifications and genome folding. While most epigenomic and transcriptional changes are initially reversed once the perturbation is removed, some loci remain transcriptionally deregulated and genome architecture partially maintains its perturbed conformation. Consequently, a second pulse of transient hyperacetylation induces stronger memory of transcriptional deregulation. Using ultradeep Micro-C, we associate memory of gene expression with repressive Polycomb-mediated chromatin topology. These results demonstrate how cells can record transient stresses in their genome architecture, thereby enabling an enhanced response to subsequent perturbations. Acute perturbation of histone acetylation induces changes in chromatin organization that are only partially reversed once the perturbation is removed and are associated with transcriptional memory effects. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02489-4?error=cookies_not_supported&code=ee11a3fc-e27c-4431-9eb9-c1655f15bf2a |
