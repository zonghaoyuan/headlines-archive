| science | Transients in the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS-I) may be associated with nuclear testing and reports of unidentified anomalous phenomena | Transient star-like objects of unknown origin have been identified in the first Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS-I) conducted prior to the first artificial satellite. We tested speculative hypotheses that some transients are related to nuclear weapons testing or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) reports. A dataset comprising daily data (11/19/49—4/28/57) regarding identified transients, nuclear testing, and UAP reports was created (n = 2,718 days). Results revealed significant (p = .008) associations between nuclear testing and observed transients, with transients 45% more likely on dates within + /- 1 day of nuclear testing. For days on which at least one transient was identified, significant associations were noted between total number of transients and total number of independent UAP reports per date (p = 0.015). For every additional UAP reported on a given date, there was an 8.5% increase in number of transients identified. Small but significant (p = .008) associations between nuclear testing and number of UAP reports were also noted. Findings suggest associations beyond chance between occurrence of transients and both nuclear testing and UAP reports. These findings may help elucidate the nature of POSS-I transients and strengthen empirical support for the UAP phenomenon. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-21620-3?error=cookies_not_supported&code=1024a75c-e710-48c4-bba5-36632bd3dcda |

| health | Parity and lactation induce T cell mediated breast cancer protection | Parity and breastfeeding reduce the risk of breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)1,2, yet the immunological mechanisms underlying this protection remain unclear. Here, we show that parity induces an accumulation of CD8+ T cells, including cells with a tissue-resident memory (TRM)-like phenotype within human normal breast tissue. In murine models, pregnancy followed by lactation and involution drove the accumulation of CD8⁺ T cells in the mammary gland, coinciding with reduced tumour growth and increased intratumoural immune cell infiltration, effects that were abrogated by CD8⁺ T cell depletion. Importantly, this CD8+ T cell dependent tumour control was only observed following a complete cycle of lactation and involution. Consistent with this, primary TNBCs from parous women exhibited greater T cell infiltration and improved clinical outcomes. Together these findings, spanning preclinical models and over 1000 patient samples, provide new insight into how reproductive history shapes breast immunity, positioning CD8⁺ T cells as key mediators of parity-associated protection and informing novel strategies for both prevention and treatment of breast cancer. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09713-5?error=cookies_not_supported&code=d0b6fa3a-dcca-4303-a0a8-1d22fa7e5bd5 |
