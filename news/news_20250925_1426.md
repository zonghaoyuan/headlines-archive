| science | A tweezer array with 6100 highly coherent atomic qubits | Optical tweezer arrays 1,2 have transformed atomic and molecular physics, now forming the backbone for a range of leading experiments in quantum computing 3–8, simulation 1,9–12, and metrology 13–15. Typical experiments trap tens to hundreds of atomic qubits, and recently systems with around one thousand atoms were realized without defining qubits or demonstrating coherent control 16–18. However, scaling to thousands of atomic qubits with long coherence times, low-loss, and high-fidelity imaging is an outstanding challenge and critical for progress in quantum science, particularly towards quantum error correction 19,20. Here, we experimentally realize an array of optical tweezers trapping over 6,100 neutral atoms in around 12,000 sites, simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art performance for several metrics that underpin the success of the platform. Specifically, while scaling to such a large number of atoms, we demonstrate a coherence time of 12.6(1) seconds, a record for hyperfine qubits in an optical tweezer array. We show room-temperature trapping lifetimes of  ~ 23 minutes, enabling record-high imaging survival of 99.98952(1)% with an imaging fidelity of over 99.99%. We present a plan for zone-based quantum computing 5,21 and demonstrate necessary coherence-preserving qubit transport and pick-up/drop-off operations on large spatial scales, characterized through interleaved randomized benchmarking. Our results, along with recent developments 8,22–24, indicate that universal quantum computing and quantum error correction with thousands to tens of thousands of physical qubits could be a near-term prospect. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09641-4?error=cookies_not_supported&code=0d125dac-b651-4919-ae15-a69937e0ed05 |

| health | SPP1 is required for maintaining mesenchymal cell fate in pancreatic cancer | Elucidating the complex network of communication between tumour cells is central to understanding cell fate decisions and progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)1,2. We previously showed that constant suppression of BMP activity by the BMP antagonist GREM1 secreted by mesenchymal PDAC cells is essential for maintaining the fate of epithelial PDAC cells3. Here we identify SPP1 (also known as osteopontin)4 as a key regulator of mesenchymal cell fate in pancreatic cancer. Proteomic analysis of plasma from patients with PDAC showed that SPP1 is substantially upregulated in late-stage disease. Inactivation of Spp1 led to a delay in tumorigenesis in mouse PDAC models and abolished metastasis formation. Spp1 was expressed in epithelial PDAC cells, and Spp1 inactivation resulted in a conversion of mesenchymal to epithelial PDAC cells. Mechanistically, SPP1 bound the CD61 receptor on mesenchymal PDAC cells to induce Bmp2 and Grem1 expression, and GREM1 inhibition of BMP signalling was required for Spp1 expression in epithelial cells, thereby forming an intercellular regulatory loop. Concomitant inactivation of Grem1 reverted the epithelial phenotype of Spp1 knockout to fully mesenchymal PDAC. Conversely, Grem1 heterozygosity combined with Spp1 knockout resulted in wild-type PDAC histology, a result that confirmed the direct antagonistic functions of these factors. Hence, mesenchymal and epithelial PDAC cell fates are determined by the reciprocal paracrine regulation of the soluble factors GREM1 and SPP1. Mutual paracrine regulation of the cytokines GREM1 and SPP1 mediate mesenchymal and epithelial cell fate in pancreatic cancer. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09574-y?error=cookies_not_supported&code=fb94a219-736f-43e8-88a4-d06d62bf4aea |

| health | LRP8 is a receptor for tick-borne encephalitis virus | Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) causes tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), a severe and sometimes life-threatening disease characterized by viral invasion of the central nervous system with symptoms of neuroinflammation1,2. As with other orthoflaviviruses—enveloped, arthropod-borne RNA viruses—host factors required for TBEV entry remain poorly defined. Here we used a genome-scale CRISPR–Cas9-based screen to identify LRP8, an apolipoprotein E and reelin receptor with high expression in the brain, as a TBEV receptor. LRP8 downregulation reduced TBEV infection in human cells, and its overexpression enhanced infection. LRP8 bound directly to the TBEV E glycoprotein and mediated viral attachment and internalization into cells. An LRP8-based soluble decoy blocked infection of human cell lines and neuronal cells and protected mice from lethal TBEV challenge. LRP8’s role as a TBEV receptor has implications for TBEV neuropathogenesis and the development of antiviral countermeasures. LRP8, an apolipoprotein E and reelin receptor with high expression in the brain, is a receptor for tick-borne encephalitis virus. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09500-2?error=cookies_not_supported&code=698d143b-8149-4e72-beb8-59eb72642a5d |
| health | Design of facilitated dissociation enables timing of cytokine signalling | Protein design has focused on the design of ground states, ensuring that they are sufficiently low energy to be highly populated1. Designing the kinetics and dynamics of a system requires, in addition, the design of excited states that are traversed in transitions from one low-lying state to another2,3. This is a challenging task because such states must be sufficiently strained to be poorly populated, but not so strained that they are not populated at all, and because protein design methods have focused on generating near-ideal structures4–7. Here we describe a general approach for designing systems that use an induced-fit power stroke8 to generate a structurally frustrated9 and strained excited state, allosterically driving protein complex dissociation. X-ray crystallography, double electron–electron resonance spectroscopy and kinetic binding measurements show that incorporating excited states enables the design of effector-induced increases in dissociation rates as high as 5,700-fold. We highlight the power of this approach by designing rapid biosensors, kinetically controlled circuits and cytokine mimics that can be dissociated from their receptors within seconds, enabling dissection of the temporal dynamics of interleukin-2 signalling. A fresh approach to protein design that incorporates excited intermediate states enables precise control over the lifetime of protein interactions, with potential applications in cell-signalling modulation and in biosensors and synthetic circuits. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09549-z?error=cookies_not_supported&code=aaae4985-372f-44be-97b0-e69d27e10246 |
