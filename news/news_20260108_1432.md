| world | Genetic switch between unicellularity and multicellularity in marine yeasts | The evolution of multicellularity is considered to be a major transition in the history of life on Earth1. In the evolution from unicellularity to obligate multicellularity, facultative clonal multicellularity may constitute an intermediate state, in which unicellular proliferation and clonal multicellular growth are switchable2–4. However, little is known about the mechanisms of switching. Here we identify the genetic and cellular basis of nutrition-responsive facultative clonal multicellularity in two black-yeast species of Dothideomycetes. Deletion of any one of ten genes in Hortaea werneckii5,6 results in near-obligate unicellularity or multicellularity. Six of these genes encode regulators of conidiation (asexual sporulation) in filamentous fungi7, despite conidiation not being observed in H. werneckii. Second-site mutations often restore or reverse the phenotype, revealing genetic flexibility underlying facultative multicellularity. A Myb protein functions as a switch-like regulator of state transitions in H. werneckii; its expression and degradation are coupled to nutrient conditions, stabilizing unicellular or multicellular growth. However, while conidiation regulators are similarly co-opted to enable facultative multicellularity, the Myb gene is dispensable in the related species Neodothiora pruni8, further highlighting molecular diversity in plasticity regulation. Ecologically, multicellular-prone H. werneckii ecotypes are isolated from sponges, and sponge-conditioned medium induces multicellularity. This study establishes a tractable model system for dissecting facultative clonal multicellularity across genetic, cellular and ecological scales, and outlines genetic and cellular strategies to gain, lose and regain multicellularity and, more broadly, phenotypic plasticity. Myb1 functions as a switch-like regulator of state transitions in Hortaea werneckii, whereby its expression and degradation are coupled to nutrient conditions, stabilizing unicellular or multicellular growth. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09881-4?error=cookies_not_supported&code=87aab568-726d-45ff-8dc6-1757502b590d |

| health | Neuro-epithelial circuits promote sensory convergence and intestinal immunity | Type 2 inflammation at barrier surfaces is an evolutionarily conserved response that promotes immunity to helminth parasites, allergic inflammation and tissue repair1–4. Direct sensing of environmental triggers by epithelial cells initiates type 2 inflammation, and signals derived from neurons can modulate immune responses5–8. However, how diverse sensory inputs from epithelial, neuronal and immune cells are coordinated and integrated remains unclear. Here we identify that TRPV1+ pain-sensing nociceptors co-opt chemosensory epithelial tuft cells to initiate a cascade of tissue responses that drive type 2 inflammation. Chemogenetic silencing or chemical ablation of TRPV1+ nociceptors results in a significant reduction in intestinal tuft cells and defective anti-helminth type 2 immunity. By contrast, chemogenetic activation of TRPV1+ nociceptors leads to remodelling of CGRP+ nerve fibres, significantly increased CGRP expression, enhanced tuft cell accumulation and protective anti-helminth type 2 immunity. Using spatial transcriptomic and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses, we reveal that nociceptor activation promotes rapid epithelial progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. Mechanistically, intestinal epithelial cell-intrinsic and tuft cell-intrinsic expression of CGRP receptor subunits are required for tuft cell responses and type 2 immunity to helminth infection. Together, these results identify sensory convergence of a neuronal–epithelial tuft cell circuit as a critical upstream determinant of type 2 immunity and tissue adaptation. Specific pain-sensing nociceptors and chemosensory tuft cells form a circuit to promote type 2 immune responses in the intestine. | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09921-z?error=cookies_not_supported&code=9ae145cb-d8f6-42db-934a-88d04f880ed9 |
