| health | Pain relief comes from more than meds. Dr. Sanjay Gupta explains your body’s natural painkillers | When headaches or sore muscles strike us at home, we reach for everyday painkillers. Usually it’s something like ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen, all analgesics known in the medical world as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs). The most common non-NSAID pain reliever is acetaminophen, or Tylenol, which isn’t an anti-inflammatory but works well to reduce fever and is typically easier on the stomach. Even before reaching for those over-the-counter meds, we may ice a sore elbow or lower back, or soak in a hot tub to ease achy muscles or joints. | https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/26/health/sanjay-gupta-pain-book-excerpt |
